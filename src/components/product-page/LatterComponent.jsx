            In an ethical approach, concerned about the environment and human
            well-being, we have our shoes made in excellent workshops in
            Portugal, with recycled wool in France, hemp in the Kana collection,
            and other materials with low environmental impact. Here you will
            find ethical sneakers for women. Ubac also offers a range of
            eco-responsible sneakers for men.
